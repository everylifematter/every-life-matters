        <h3>Understanding the Impact of Abortion</h3>
        <p>Abortion not only ends the life of an unborn child but also has lasting emotional and physical consequences for the mother. Many women experience feelings of regret, depression, and guilt after an abortion. It is important to provide women with the support and resources they need to make informed decisions and to help them choose life for their child.</p>
        <p>In the United States, approximately 1 in 4 pregnancies end in abortion. However, many women who have undergone abortions later regret their decision and speak out about the need for better alternatives, such as adoption and parenting support.</p>
        <p>Choosing life is always a better option, and providing the right support can help women and families flourish. Pro-life organizations and pregnancy centers are crucial in offering this support and ensuring that both the mother and the baby can thrive.</p>
